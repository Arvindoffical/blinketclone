## About
**BlinketClone** is a clone of Blinket (formerly Grofers)—a quick commerce delivery platform. It simulates browsing grocery items, adding them to cart, and placing orders for fast home delivery. Great as a learning project or quick commerce UI/UX prototype.

---

## Features
- Browse products by categories
- View product details and similar recommendations
- Add to cart, view/edit cart
- Place orders and (optionally) simulate order flow
- Authentication (if implemented): Login/Register
- Admin dashboard for product management (if included)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (or your specific framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (or your backend framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (or your choice)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (or CSS-in-JS, Bootstrap, etc.)
- **State Management**: Redux / Context API (optional)

---

## Architecture
```
[Your Architecture Diagram / Description Here]
```
A typical flow:
1. React UI → API calls to backend
2. Backend handles authentication, product CRUD, cart operations, orders
3. Data stored in database; server interacts with frontend via REST or GraphQL APIs.
